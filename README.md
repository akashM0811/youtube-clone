ðŸ“º YouTube Clone â€“ HTML & CSS
This is a front-end clone of YouTube built using only HTML and CSS. It replicates the layout and design of YouTubeâ€™s homepage, including the header, sidebar, and video grid. The project is fully static and responsive, making it a great demonstration of modern layout techniques using Flexbox and Grid.
